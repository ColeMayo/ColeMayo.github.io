### Final SWE Blog
At last, the end is here! This has been quite the semester of software engineering. It seems like every undergrad in the department talks about how great this class is recommends that all the youngins take it. I would think a huge portion of the student body does end up taking it just for the writing flag. It is surprising to me that the writing flag is included in this course because there really isn't that much writing to be done. Encouraging the blog is a good thing, but I think it should be required. I also think a nice change to the blog/writing post is if some of them were required to be a more technical write up. It might encourage students to be more adventurous when learning a new language or tool. As I type this out I'm realizing this might just be one route that students could use the pick of the week on.

Anyway, as everyone said, this class ended up being pretty great. Most of the topics that we cover seem like they will be useful someday in the real world, which is a lot more than I can say for other classes that I've taken. Getting to work with a team and making a website was a fun and rewarding process. Python seems like a great language. The annoying things that Downing requires for the projects look more worthwhile in retrospect. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who plans to work in software engineering post graduation.
